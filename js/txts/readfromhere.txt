The nWo storyline was an idea WCW Executive Vice President Eric Bischoff was inspired by after attending New Japan Pro Wrestling's Battle Formation show at the Tokyo Dome on April 29, 1996. The show was headlined by a NJPW vs. UWF International match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, as Shinya Hashimoto defeated Nobuhiko Takada. He wanted to do an invasion-type angle where WCW was being sabotaged by another wrestling group (initially insinuated as being the WWF, since its founding members had previously wrestled for the company). The nWo was originally portrayed as a separate entity from WCW (often, propaganda-style vignettes and product commercials concerning the nWo were preceded by an "interruption in the feed" and a voice proclaiming, "The following announcement has been paid for by the New World Order").
Others, such as Kevin Nash, television director Craig Leathers, chief WCW booker Terry Taylor, and Taylor's assistants Kevin Sullivan and Paul Orndorff, all contributed their own ideas to the nWo concept.
